# Functions

Functions is a basic Wordpress plugin created as a placeholder to keep custom functions independent of your theme functions.php.

Right now it only contains a function which overrides the mailer content type to text/html. 

No admin or configuration available, you need to add your functions in the code. This plugin is just a placeholder for that.

## Installation

Download the code, zip it and install it in your wordpress like any other plugin.

## Usage

Activate and enjoy.
